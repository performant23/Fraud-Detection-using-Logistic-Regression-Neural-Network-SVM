## Introduction

In this project, we analyze a dataset containing transactional data and build multiple models to detect fraudulent activities. We explore various machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), and a neural network, to classify transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate. The project focuses on preprocessing the data, selecting relevant features, handling imbalanced classes, and evaluating the performance of the models.

## Data Preprocessing

We start by performing data preprocessing steps to prepare the dataset for model training. This includes one-hot encoding categorical variables, feature selection, sampling the data to handle computational complexity, and standardizing the data to ensure fair comparisons between features.

## Model Training and Evaluation

We train different machine learning models on the preprocessed data and evaluate their performance. Logistic regression, SVM, and a neural network are applied to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate. We split the data into training and testing sets, tune hyperparameters using GridSearchCV, and assess the models' accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC score. The models' strengths and weaknesses are analyzed to identify the best-performing model for fraud detection.

## Results and Performance

The results of the model evaluation demonstrate the effectiveness of the selected models in detecting fraudulent transactions. The logistic regression model achieves the highest accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC score compared to SVM and the neural network. These metrics indicate the model's ability to accurately predict fraud cases while minimizing false positives.

## Future Enhancements

To further improve the fraud detection system, future enhancements can be considered:

- Explore ensemble methods such as random forests or gradient boosting to combine the predictions of multiple models and increase overall performance.
- Investigate anomaly detection algorithms that can identify unusual patterns or outliers in the data, which may be indicative of fraud.
